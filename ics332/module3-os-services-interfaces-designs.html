      '## Operating System Services/Features\n' +
      '* The OS should provide the following services:\n' +
      '      * Process Management\n' +
      '      * Memory Management\n' +
      '      * Storage Management\n' +
      '      * I/O Management\n' +
      '      * Protection and Security\n' +
      '* The OS should provide the following user interfaces:\n' +
      '      * Interactives, APIs\n' +
      '      \n' +
      '### Process Management\n' +
      '* Recall that a process is a running program\n' +
      '      * program: passive (static bytes on disk)\n' +
      '      * process: active (evolving bytes in RAM, fetch-decode-execute cycle)\n' +
      '      * There can be many processes for a single program\n' +
      '* The OS virtualizes the CPU by providing:\n' +
      '      * Mechanisms for creating and destroying processes\n' +
      '      * Mechanisms for suspending and resuming processes\n' +
      '      * Mechanisms for process communication\n' +
      '      * Mechanisms for process synchronization\n' +
      '* The OS is responsible for:\n' +
      '      * Deciding which process runs when and for how long\n' +
      '      \n' +
      '### Memory Management\n' +
      '* The OS virtualizes the RAM by providing:\n' +
      '      * An address space for each processes (so that the process thinks itâ€™s alone in RAM)\n' +
      '* The OS is responsible for:\n' +
      '      * Keeping track of which parts of memory are currently being used and by which process\n' +
      '      * Deciding which process data to move into and out of memory\n' +
      '      * Allocating and de-allocating memory space as needed\n' +
      '* The OS is NOT responsible for the caches (which is 100% managed by the hardware)\n' +
      '\n' +
      '### Storage Management\n' +
      '* The OS virtualizes storage by providing a structured, logical view of data stored as files, which we typically call the File System, which provides mechanisms for:\n' +
      '      * Creating and deleting files and directories\n' +
      '      * Manipulating files and directories\n' +
      '      * Mapping files onto secondary storage\n' +
      '      * Backing up files onto stable (non-volatile) storage media\n' +
      '* The OS is responsible for:\n' +
      '      * Keep track of all files/directories and where they are on disk\n' +
      '      * Free-space management\n' +
      '      * Storage allocation\n' +
      '      \n' +
      '### I/O Management\n' +
      '* The OS virtualizes all I/O devices by hiding the specifics of these devices from the user\n' +
      '* The OS is responsible for:\n' +
      '      * Memory management of I/O, including buffering (storing data temporarily while it is being transferred), spooling (the overlapping of output of one job with input of other jobs), etc.\n' +
      '      * General device-driver interface - So that multiple devices can be used with the same kernel as long as they comply with some standard interface\n' +
      '      * Implementing/loading drivers for specific hardware devices\n' +
      '\n' +
      '## OS Roles\n' +
      '* **Protection**: Mechanisms for controlling access of processes to resources defined by the OS\n' +
      '* **Security**: Defense of the system against internal and external attacks including denial-of-service, worms, viruses, identity theft, theft of service..\n' +
      '\n' +
      '## User Interfaces\n' +
      '* CLI - Command Line Interace (Shell)\n' +
      '* GUI - Graphical User Interface\n' +
      '* Batch - Historical Human Interface\n' +
      '\n' +
      '## System Call API\n' +
      '* System call API (Application Programming interface) is the "lowest-level" interface to OS services\n' +
      '* GUI and CLI are built on top of this API\n' +
      '* Every program uses this API either directly, indirectly, or libraries\n' +
      '* Each system call is identified by a unique number.\n' +
      '* These numbers are stored in an internal table named **syscall table**\n' +
      '* System calls make it possible to access **virtualized** hardware resources\n' +
      '* **System Call Interface** - Set of useful functions that are "Easier-to-use" wrappers" around the raw system calls and that are provided in standard libraries\n' +
      '\n' +
      '#### strace \n' +
      '* Linux Tool to "Spy on processes" and see the system calls they place as they happen\n' +
      '\n' +
      '## Timing Programs\n' +
      '* When measuring System Time with `time`, real time does not equal user time + system time\n' +
      '* Real Time = User Time + System Time + I/O Time\n' +
      '\n' +
      '## Mechanisms and Policies\n' +
      '* **Policy** - what should be done\n' +
      '* **Mechanism** - how it should be done\n' +
      '* Separation of these two principles is important so that one can change policy without changing mechanisms\n' +

      '## OS Design: Modules\n' +
      '* Most modern OSes implement modules\n' +
      '* **Loadable modules** - Load at **boot time** or at **runtime** when needed\n';
