      '## ENIAC\n' +
      '* Electronic Numerical Integrator and Computer aka "Giant Brain"\n' +
      '* First electronic general-purpose computer\n' +
      '\n' +
      '## Von Neumann Architecture Model\n' +
      '1. **Central Processing Unit** *performs operations* and *controls the sequence of operations*\n' +
      '2. **Memory Unit** contains *code* and data*\n' +
      '3. **Input and Output (I/O)**\n' +

      '## Memory Unit\n' +
      '* Memory or RAM (Random Access Memory)\n' +
      '* The memory is basically an indexed array of bytes\n' +
      '* 1 Byte = 8 bits\n' +
      '* The memory contains numerical data. The data are represented in memory in binary as bytes. \n' +
      '* **Addresses** are unique binary bytes that contain the location of a data byte in memory. \n' +
      '\n' +
      '![Icon](@attachment/2.png)\n' +
      '\n' +
      '#### Example\n' +
      '![Icon](@attachment/3.png)\n' +
      '\n' +
      '`Instruction: At address 1000 0000, store the address of the first \'9\' (0000 1001) in memory`\n' +
      '* This action is called **indirection**\n' +
      '* **Pointer/Reference** - The content at a memory location is the address of another memory location\n' +
      '\n' +
      '## Binary Instruction Encoding\n' +
      '* **Assembler** - Transforms assembly code into binary code\n' +
      '* Instructions are *encoded in binary*, based on the specification of the microprocessor your computer uses. aka "Opcode" \n' +
      '\n' +
      '![Icon](@attachment/4.png)\n' +
      '\n' +
      '* The program is stored in RAM/Memory *along with some data*\n' +
      '* Once a program is loaded in memory, its **address space** contains both *code* and *data*\n' +

      '\n' +
      '*Note that the result is reverse of the computation*\n' +
      '\n' +
      '## Central Processing Unit (CPU)\n' +
      '* The CPU reads data from memory into registers, writes data from registers to memory, and computes\n' +
      '* The component that performs the computational operations is called the **ALU (Arithmetic and Logic Unit)**\n' +
      '* Operands and results of operations must all be **in registers**\n' +
      '* The CPU also *controls the execution of the program\'s instructions*\n' +
      '* **Control Unit** - Component in charge of controlling program execution, and it uses dedicated *registers*:\n' +
      '     * **Program Counter** - Contains the address of the next instruction that should be executed: is incremented after each instruction but can be set to whatever address when there is a change in control flow\n' +
      '     * **Current Instruction** - The binary code of the instruction which is currently being executed.\n' +
      '     * Other registers: Stack pointer, Frame pointer, ...\n' +
      '* The Control Unit *decodes* the instructions (interprets their bits) and makes them happen.\n' +
      '\n' +
      '## Fetch-Decode-Execute Cycle\n' +
      '1. The Control Unit *fetches* the next program instruction from memory using the program counter.\n' +
      '2. The instruction is *decoded* and signals are sent to hardware components\n' +
      '3. The instruction is *executed*:\n' +
      '      * Values are fetched from memory and put in registers\n' +
      '      * Computation is performed by the ALU and results are stored in registers\n' +
      '      * Register values are pushed back to memory\n' +
      '      * Program state is modified (Program Counter, Stack Pointer, ...)\n' +
      '4. Repeat\n' +
      '\n' +
      '* The cycle is pipelined: Fetch the instruction `i + 1` while instruction `i` is being executed.\n' +
      '\n' +
      '#### Example\n' +
      '![Icon](@attachment/9.png)\n' +
      '\n' +
      '`What is the *decimal* value of register B when the program terminates?`\n' +
      '\n' +
      '##### Note that I do not accurately draw the process of updating the PC and CI visually. It is implied that the CI is updated with the content from Steps 2. And technically the PC is supposed to be updated with the next address as soon as the CI is updated. But in these drawings, I only update the PC after each drawing.\n' +
      '\n' +

      '1. In our initial state, the address `0000 0001` is already loaded into our *Program Counter* (PC). \n' +
      '2. We look at the content of our address. `000` is our Opcode which stands for "Load to register A from memory"\n' +
      '3. The entire content `000 10011` from Step 2 is a *pointer* that corresponds to another memory address `0001 0011`. Converting the content at this pointer address from binary gives us *135d*.\n' +
      '4. We then load the content from Step 3 into register A.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'TL;DR: **A <-- 135d**\n' +
      '\n' +
      '![Icon](@attachment/11.png)\n' +
      '1. We load address `0000 0010` into our PC.\n' +
      '2. We look at the content of our address. `010` is our Opcode which stands for "Add B to A; store result in A". As stated in our Opcode instructions, we can ignore the 5-bit operand `00000`.\n' +
      '3. We add the content in B to A. Currently, the content at B `0000 0110` converts to *6d*. Therefore, *6d* + *135d* = *141d*\n' +
      '4. We store the results from Step 3 into register A.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'TL;DR: **A <-- 6d + 135d = 141d**\n' +
      '\n' +
      '![Icon](@attachment/12.png)\n' +
      '1. We load address `0000 0011` into our PC.\n' +
      '2. We look at the content of our address. `011` is our Opcode which stands for "Store the value of A to memory." Based on the 5-bit operand of our content, we are instructed to store this in the memory address `10111`.\n' +
      '3. We store the current value of A, which is *141d*, into the address `0001 0111` which corresponds to `10111` from Step 2.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'TL;DR: **(0001 0111) <-- 141d**\n' +
      '\n' +
      '![Icon](@attachment/13.png)\n' +
      '1. We load address `0000 0100` into our PC.\n' +
      '2. We look at the content of our address. `001` is our Opcode which stands for "Load to register B from memory." \n' +
      '3. The entire content of the address `001 10111` (Note that we ignore a missing 0 at the start because it doesn\'t matter in this step context) is a *pointer* to the new memory address that we created from the previous drawing, `0001 0111`.\n' +
      '4. We then store the content of the *pointer* address `0001 0111`, which is *141d* into register B.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'TL;DR: **B <-- (0001 0111) = 141d**\n' +
      '\n' +
      'The last address that we put into our PC is `0000 0101` which has the content `111 00000`. Our Opcode is `111` which Halts the program, and we can ignore the 5-bit operand. Therefore, our final state is:\n' +

      '### RAM is Slow\n' +
      '* Biggest issue: *memory is slow* while *accessing a register is very fast*\n' +
      '* "Von-Neumann Bottleneck" - CPU does *nothing* while waiting for memory to give data\n' +
      '* We use a trick called **memory hierarchy** to provide the illusion of a fast memory.\n' +
      '\n' +
      '![Icon](@attachment/6.png)\n' +
      '\n' +
      '#### Cache\n' +
      '* When a program accesses a byte in memory:\n' +
      '      * It checks whether the byte is in cache, and if so, it just gets it.\n' +
      '      * Otherwise, the byte value is brought from the (slow) memory into the (fast) cache.\n' +
      '      * The values **around the byte** are also brought into the cache.\n' +
      '* **Temporal Locality**\n' +
      '> A program tends to reference addresses it has already referenced\n' +
      '\n' +
      '> The first access is expensive while each subsequent accesses are cheap (The value is in cache!)\n' +
      '\n' +
      '* **Spatial Locality**\n' +
      '> A program tends to reference addresses next to addresses it has already referenced\n' +
      '\n' +
      '> The access to element *i* is expensive while access to elements *i* + 1, *i* + 2, ... are cheap (The value is in cache!)\n' +
      '\n' +
      '* There is more than one level of cache (L1, L2, L3)\n' +
      '* L1 (closest/fastest to CPU) is split into **Data Cache** and **Instructions Cache**\n' +
      '* **Chunks** of data are brought from (far-away) memory and are copied and kept around in (nearby) caches.\n' +
      '* **Cache Hit** - When a data item is found in cache (e.g., "L2 cache hit")\n' +
      '* **Cache Miss** - When a data item is not found in cache (e.g., "L1 cache miss")\n' +
      '\n' +
      '## Direct Memory Access (DMA)\n' +
      '* **Direct Memory Access** is the action when the CPU is *doing something useful while the memory copy is taking place*\n' +
      '* DMA Process:\n' +
      '      1. CPU tells DMA controller to initiate a RAM copy\n' +
      '      2. When copy is complete, the DMA controller tells the CPU "it\'s done" by generating an interrupt\n' +
      '      3. In the meantime, the CPU was free to do whatever\n' +
      '* The DMA controller uses the memory bus to perform data transfers. The code executed by the CPU likely also uses the memory bus. Therefore, they can interfere with each other. Regardless, using DMA leads to better performance.\n' +
      '* Because we cannot increase clock rate further (power/heat issues), our current CPUs are **multi-core**';
